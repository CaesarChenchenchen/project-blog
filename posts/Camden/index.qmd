# Introduction
Camden, NJ, a historic and industrial urban center located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, is in many ways a polemic example of the story of the post-industrial city. Once a key player in the most industrious region of the country, Camden was home to shipbuilding, canning, and many other manufacturing uses due to its proximity to markets, ports, heavy rail and related infrastructure. Like many similar Northeast and Midwest cities with an industrial and manufacturing past, the period of de-industrialization and urban renewal had drastically disparate impacts among Camden’s communities of color. Many of the challenges Camden still faces are attributable to the discrimminatory socio-economic doctrines and unjust political power imbalances that existed during these eras of urban development.”
