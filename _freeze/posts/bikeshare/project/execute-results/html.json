Indego Bike is one of the earliest bicycle sharing system in Philadelphia. Bicycling has become more prevalent and important in Philadelphia because of the city's smaller center city size and more bike-friendly streets.\nHowever, Bikesharing is also affected by how to balance the number of bikes at each station, which can be framed as ‘re-balancing’. This issue arises from the spatial and temporal variations in user demand. If a station has a large number of bikes in use making parking impossible or if there are no bikes available at a certain time due to the time of day this can lead to inefficiencies in sharing bikes.\nTherefore, the goal of this report is to rapidly predict the demand for bikes across various stations in Philadelphia. We will perform analysis on the historical data on bike usage at different space, time and weather conditions. The forecast allows the Indego Bike to proactively address imbalances, strategically re-positioning bikes in anticipation of peak usage time or special events.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='project_cache/html/setup_13_5287253512e76e848a87a04acde3edb6'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(tigris)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(riem)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(RSocrata)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(spdep)\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(ckanr)\nlibrary(FNN)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(ggcorrplot) # plot correlation plot\nlibrary(corrr)      # another way to plot correlation plot\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(jtools)     # for regression model plots\nlibrary(ggstance) # to support jtools plots\nlibrary(ggpubr)    # plotting R^2 value on ggplot point scatter\nlibrary(broom.mixed) # needed for effects plots\nlibrary(vtable)\nlibrary(gganimate)\nlibrary(gifski)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urbanSpatial/Public-Policy-Analytics-Landing/master/functions.r\")\ndevtools::install_github('thomasp85/gganimate')\n\nplotTheme <- theme(\n  plot.title =element_text(size=12),\n  plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8),\n  plot.caption = element_text(size = 6),\n  axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n  axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10),\n  # Set the entire chart region to blank\n  panel.background=element_blank(),\n  plot.background=element_blank(),\n  #panel.border=element_rect(colour=\"#F0F0F0\"),\n  # Format the grid\n  panel.grid.major=element_line(colour=\"#D0D0D0\",size=.2),\n  axis.ticks=element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: The `size` argument of `element_line()` is deprecated as of ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` argument instead.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmapTheme <- theme(plot.title =element_text(size=12),\n                  plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8),\n                  plot.caption = element_text(size = 6),\n                  axis.line=element_blank(),\n                  axis.text.x=element_blank(),\n                  axis.text.y=element_blank(),\n                  axis.ticks=element_blank(),\n                  axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n                  axis.title.y=element_blank(),\n                  panel.background=element_blank(),\n                  panel.border=element_blank(),\n                  panel.grid.major=element_line(colour = 'transparent'),\n                  panel.grid.minor=element_blank(),\n                  legend.direction = \"vertical\", \n                  legend.position = \"right\",\n                  plot.margin = margin(1, 1, 1, 1, 'cm'),\n                  legend.key.height = unit(1, \"cm\"), legend.key.width = unit(0.2, \"cm\"))\n\npalette5 <- c(\"#eff3ff\",\"#bdd7e7\",\"#6baed6\",\"#3182bd\",\"#08519c\")\npalette4 <- c(\"#D2FBD4\",\"#92BCAB\",\"#527D82\",\"#123F5A\")\npalette2 <- c(\"#6baed6\",\"#08519c\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Data Load\n## Indego Bike Use Data\nThe data of Indego shared bike usage is from the open data in Indego Website. the data include the first quarter usage information in 2023.

Our thorough analysis reveals that a combination of spatial, temporal, and weather-related factors significantly influences the fluctuating demands for bikeshare services. A key finding of our study is the enhanced accuracy in predicting hourly bikeshare demand by considering the number of trips in the preceding and following hours, as well as the demand during the same hour on the previous day. Furthermore, the demand for bikes at neighboring stations also provides valuable predictive insights. We observed that the demand peaks during the evening rush hours and overnight on weekdays, suggesting a strong connection with work commute patterns. Notably, the bikeshare stations in central Philadelphia and university areas experience the highest usage, underscoring their critical role in meeting the transportation needs of the city's residents. This suggests a distinct urban mobility pattern where bikesharing is predominantly used for commuting in these densely populated areas.\n",
